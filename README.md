# easy-linefeed

Normally, simply pressing ```enter``` would create a newline only in the editor and not in the display.
To create a new line in the display, you'd normally two spaces at the end of the first line, but that's tedious to do every time.

With this plugin, simply type ```shift+enter``` to add two spaces and a newline that will indent with the current line.

## installation

```ipm install easy-linefeed```
